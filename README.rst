Description
===========

This course introduces basic computing and programming 
with a particular view to the kinds of basic skills 
one needs to deal with data from language and speech 
in a Unix-like_ operating environment. 

.. _Unix-like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX-like

It is intended for students who have no prior computing background.



Prerequisites
=============

2. Students who have no particular interest in the computational track, but who nonetheless have the need to process linguistic data.
