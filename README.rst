Description
===========

This course introduces basic computing and programming 
with a particular view to the kinds of basic skills 
one needs to deal with data from language and speech 
in a Unix-like_ operating environment. 

.. _Unix-like: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX-like

It is intended for students who have no prior computing background.


Objectives
==========

By the end of this class, students should be able to confidently:

* Navigate, manipulate, and search Unix-like_ files and directory structures using bash
* Understand and use regular expressions to manipulate text
* Understand and make use of basic version control with git
* Write shell scripts to manipulate text using standard Unix utilities
* Write programs in Python

Target Audience
===============

This course is intended to serve:

1. Students who have had no prior computing experience who wish to pursue courses in `Computational Linguistics`_ starting with `LING 406`_ and moving on to `LING 506`_ and `LING 591`_.
2. Students who have no particular interest in the computational track, but who nonetheless have the need to process linguistic data.
3. Students who want to develop proficiency with the Linux command line, shell scripting, and Python
